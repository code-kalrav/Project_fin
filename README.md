### What to do
1. Capital Expenditure on Climate Resilience and Mitigation
   - Focus: Assess the capital investments made by a company to enhance climate resilience (e.g., infrastructure upgrades, energy efficiency projects) or reduce its carbon footprint (e.g., renewable energy, carbon capture).
   - Research Angle: Analyze the return on investment (ROI), payback period, and overall financial impact of these capital expenditures on the company's balance sheet and long-term competitiveness.
2. Carbon Pricing and Financial Planning
   - Focus: Analyze how existing or anticipated carbon pricing (e.g., carbon taxes, emissions trading schemes) impacts a company's financial planning, including pricing strategies, product costs, and margins.
   - Research Angle: Evaluate how different levels of carbon pricing could affect the profitability, cost structure, and competitiveness of companies in various sectors.
3. Tax Implications of Climate Investments and Incentives
    - Focus: Investigate how tax incentives for renewable energy, energy efficiency, or carbon reduction influence a company's financial decisions and effective tax rates.
    - Research Angle: Evaluate the financial benefits of leveraging government incentives or tax credits for climate-related investments.

### Papers to read for CapEx - Climate relation

Here are summaries and methodologies of the three research papers I mentioned earlier:

### 1. **Operational versus Capital Expenditure Risk in a Clean Energy Transition**
   - **Summary**: This report by Brian C. Prest and Jordan Wingenroth investigates the comparative risks associated with traditional fossil fuel assets and green energy investments. It argues that while fossil fuel assets primarily face operational expenditure (OPEX) risks, green assets are more affected by capital expenditure (CapEx) risks. The authors demonstrate that an all-green investment portfolio generally has lower cost uncertainty than an all-fossil portfolio. This research underscores the importance of green investments in reducing long-term cost volatility due to fuel price spikes and regulatory risks associated with fossil fuels.
   - **Methodology**: The paper employs a dynamic economic model of investment under uncertainty, comparing the risk profiles of fossil and green energy assets. The model calculates the cost uncertainties associated with different types of energy investments and simulates the effects of replacing fossil assets with green alternatives to estimate the impact on overall portfolio risk.

### 2. **Climate Innovation and the New CapEx Cycle**
   - **Summary**: This research focuses on how the need for climate resilience is driving a new cycle of capital expenditures in various industries. It highlights the role of technological innovations, especially in decarbonization, clean energy, and climate adaptation strategies, as key drivers of CapEx. The study also discusses the financial challenges faced by companies in shifting toward sustainable investments.
   - **Methodology**: The study analyzes historical CapEx trends in energy, transportation, and other industries, alongside case studies of corporations investing in green technology. It uses economic and financial data to evaluate the returns on green investments compared to traditional investments and measures their long-term sustainability and impact on climate goals【8†source】

### 3. **The Relationship Between Climate Risk and Physical and Organizational Capital**
   - **Summary**: This paper explores how climate risks influence the investment decisions of companies regarding physical and organizational capital. It finds that companies in industries highly exposed to climate risks, such as agriculture and manufacturing, prioritize investment in physical assets like infrastructure and technology upgrades. However, these companies reduce their spending on organizational capital (e.g., workforce training and development) due to the uncertainty caused by climate-related events.
   - **Methodology**: The authors use empirical data from various sectors to analyze how firms adjust their CapEx and OPEX in response to climate risk. They apply econometric models to assess the effects of extreme weather events and regulatory changes on corporate investment behavior. The data is drawn from financial reports, climate risk disclosures, and historical climate events

These summaries provide insights into how CapEx is increasingly shaped by climate concerns, and the methodologies used reflect a combination of economic modeling, empirical analysis, and case study evaluations.

### Carbon pricing in India

Yes, India does have mechanisms related to carbon pricing, but it does not yet have a comprehensive national carbon tax or an emissions trading scheme like the European Union Emissions Trading System (EU ETS). However, India has implemented several measures that indirectly price carbon or encourage reductions in carbon emissions. Here are some of the key carbon pricing mechanisms and related initiatives in India:

#### 1. **Perform, Achieve, and Trade (PAT) Scheme**
- **Description:** The PAT scheme, launched by the Bureau of Energy Efficiency (BEE) under the National Mission for Enhanced Energy Efficiency (NMEEE), is a market-based mechanism that aims to improve energy efficiency in energy-intensive industries. It is a form of **cap-and-trade** for energy savings.
- **How it Works:** Designated consumers in sectors like cement, iron and steel, aluminum, fertilizer, and thermal power plants are given specific energy consumption reduction targets. Those who exceed their targets can earn Energy Saving Certificates (ESCerts), which can be traded with other entities that are unable to meet their targets.
- **Relation to Carbon Pricing:** Although the PAT scheme primarily targets energy efficiency, it indirectly helps in reducing carbon emissions by incentivizing lower energy consumption, which typically results in lower CO2 emissions.

#### 2. **Renewable Energy Certificates (REC) Mechanism**
- **Description:** The REC mechanism was introduced to promote renewable energy generation in India. RECs are market-based instruments that represent proof that electricity has been generated from a renewable energy source.
- **How it Works:** Entities obligated to meet Renewable Purchase Obligations (RPOs) can buy RECs to meet their targets if they cannot generate or procure renewable energy directly.
- **Relation to Carbon Pricing:** While RECs are not a direct form of carbon pricing, they encourage the shift towards low-carbon energy sources, indirectly contributing to reduced carbon emissions.

#### 3. **Coal Cess (Clean Environment Cess)**
- **Description:** India introduced a coal cess in 2010, initially at INR 50 per ton, which was gradually increased to INR 400 (approximately USD 5.4) per ton. This cess was levied on both domestically produced and imported coal.
- **How it Works:** The revenue generated from this cess is used to fund the National Clean Energy Fund (NCEF), which supports renewable energy projects, environmental initiatives, and research and development in clean energy technologies.
- **Relation to Carbon Pricing:** The coal cess acts as a de facto carbon tax on coal consumption, thereby indirectly pricing carbon emissions associated with coal-fired power generation.

#### 4. **Subsidies and Incentives for Renewable Energy**
- **Description:** India has implemented various subsidies, tax incentives, and support schemes to promote renewable energy, such as the Accelerated Depreciation benefit, capital subsidies, and viability gap funding for solar projects.
- **Relation to Carbon Pricing:** These measures effectively reduce the cost of renewable energy relative to fossil fuels, indirectly creating a price signal that discourages high-carbon energy sources.

#### 5. **Future Carbon Market Plans**
- **Description:** India is considering the development of a domestic carbon market in alignment with its commitments under the Paris Agreement. The Indian government has discussed creating a voluntary carbon market to help achieve its Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) and to provide a framework for companies to trade carbon credits domestically.
- **Current Status:** While plans for a comprehensive carbon market are still in the development phase, India is expected to gradually adopt more robust carbon pricing mechanisms to meet its climate goals, especially as international pressure and domestic environmental concerns grow.

#### 6. **State-Level Initiatives**
- **Description:** Some Indian states, such as Gujarat and Tamil Nadu, have piloted state-specific emissions trading schemes (ETS) for particulate matter. Gujarat launched the world's first market-based trading program for particulate pollution in 2019.
- **Relation to Carbon Pricing:** Although these are primarily targeted at air quality, they demonstrate the potential for expanding market-based approaches to include carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases.

#### 7. **International Carbon Trading Participation**
- **Description:** Under the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) of the Kyoto Protocol, Indian companies have been active participants in generating Certified Emission Reductions (CERs) through clean energy projects, which are sold to entities in countries with carbon reduction commitments.
- **Relation to Carbon Pricing:** Although the CDM has faced challenges, India's participation indicates its openness to engaging in carbon trading on an international scale.

#### 8. **Corporate Carbon Pricing Initiatives**
- **Description:** Some Indian companies, especially those with international exposure or strong sustainability mandates, have begun using internal carbon pricing to account for their emissions. Companies like Tata Group, Mahindra & Mahindra, and ITC have implemented internal carbon pricing mechanisms to guide their investment decisions towards lower carbon options.
- **Relation to Carbon Pricing:** Internal carbon pricing reflects a growing awareness within the private sector of the risks associated with carbon emissions and the need to align with global climate goals.
